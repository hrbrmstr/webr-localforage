![](src/preview.png)

## When you need to keep R stuff around for a bit.

Experiment hypothesis:

>We can keep actual R objects around for a while thanks to R's `[un]serialze()` and [`localForage`](https://localforage.github.io/localForage/)

Experiment parameters:

- Webr
- (New!) The ^^ mentioned `localForage`
- (New!) A fairly reusable (but basic) Lit component to display a data frame with selected columns
- Lit (web components)
- Vite (for building)
