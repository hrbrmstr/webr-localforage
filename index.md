# üß™ üï∏Ô∏è ü´ô WebR + localForage

<status-message id="webr-status" text="WebR Loading‚Ä¶"></status-message>

## When you need to keep R stuff around for a bit.

Experiment hypothesis:

>We can keep actual R objects around for a while thanks to R's `[un]serialze()` and [`localForage`](https://localforage.github.io/localForage/)

Experiment parameters:

- Webr
- <span class="pill">New!</span> The ^^ mentioned `localForage`
- <span class="pill">New!</span> A fairly reusable (but basic) Lit component to display a data frame with selected columns
- Lit (web components)
- Vite (for building)

## If nothing else, you _sure_ are a persistent one, hrbrmstr

Aye, that I am!

I'm willing to bet you _(almost)_ never use R's super cool [`serialize()`]([removeLabel](https://rdrr.io/r/base/serialize.html)) function (directly). That function takes an R object and transforms it into a format that can be persisted outside R. If the second parameter to it is `NULL`, then you get back a `raw` vector. It has a corresponding `unserialize()` which does what you think it does.

Modern browsers have [lots of ways to store things locally](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Client-side_storage). You can _persist_ data as well, meaning you can store stuff ‚Äî like R objects! ‚Äî to be used later. This could come in handy!

Using those storage APIs directly is, quite frankly, painful. However, that [`localForage`](https://localforage.github.io/localForage/) library abstracts the pain away, providing familiar key/value idioms to store, retrieve, and remove persisted copies of any data. That means we can do something like this:

```js
const res = await R`serialize(mtcars, NULL)`
await lf.setItem('mtcars', res.values)
```

We can get that back from local storage via:

```js
const opts = {
  env: { mtcars_serialized: await lf.getItem('mtcars') }
}
const res = await webR.evalR("unserialize(as.raw(mtcars_serialized))", opts)
```

And, we can get rid of it just as easily:

```js
await lf.removeItem('mtcars')
```

If you open up Developer Tools, you'll see the bytes for the serialized first row of `mtcars` (I did not want to clutter up this page with hex string output). `res.values` contains the entire copy of `mtcars` in that raw format.

You should not go crazy with this feature, meaning try not to DoS your visitors with a gigantic amount of local storage. And, you will need to read up on `localForage` and web client storage in general to grok the nuances, limits, and "gotchas".

Reading up on R's `[un]serialize()` is also required, since there are limits to what it can do, especially with complex objects (an example of which might be parsed HTML/XML via {xml2}).

## Some JavaScript Stuff

`main.js` does all the hard work (it is also annotated), so I avoided putting large swaths of code blocks in this write-up.

There are four oddly (for me) reusable Lit web components included:

- `status-message`: _(you know this one by now)_
- `simple-message`: Basic message displayer without much adornment
- `action-button`: Generic action button _(pass in a label and click handler)_
- `data-frame-view`: It doesn't validate that you passed in a valid data frame (i.e., a full [`WebRDataJsNull`](https://docs.r-wasm.org/webr/latest/api/js/modules/RObject.html#webrdatajsnull) `data.frame` structure), but if you do pass one in with a label and columns to display, it'll toss out a basic scrollable `div` with said table. It could be way more generic, but it should be sufficient for you to riff from.

## FIN

Go forth and persist all the things!
